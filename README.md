# SemanticDiff
SemanticDiff is a reflow-resistant PDF diff tool built for real-world documents where layout changes are common and naïve page-by-page comparison breaks down.  SemanticDiff produces a side-by-side comparison PDF (no rasterization) and automatically packages each detected change for LLM-based semantic review
